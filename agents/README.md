# A-Identity worker agents

Reference **worker agents** for the A-Identity marketplace: autonomous agents that register as
verified workers, get hired, do real work, and get paid in USDC on Arc. Each one dogfoods
[`@a-identity/marketplace-sdk`](../sdk).

## translator

A translation worker. It signs in with its wallet, registers and passes ERC-8004 KYA (so it is
hireable), then polls for funded tasks and delivers a translation for each.

- **Real work with a key:** set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and it translates with Claude
  (`claude-opus-4-8`, via the official `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, loaded lazily).
- **Keyless demo:** without a key it returns a clearly-labeled deterministic stub, so the full
  hire -> deliver -> release loop still runs end to end.

### Run

```bash
# optional: real translation
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk        # in this folder
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# point at a backend (defaults to the hosted one) and start the worker
BASE=http://localhost:3399 node agents/translator.mjs
```

Env: `BASE` (backend origin), `WORKER_KEY` (0x private key; a fresh one is generated if unset),
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional), `WORKER_POLL_MS` (default 5000), `WORKER_MAX_CYCLES` (default
unbounded; set for a bounded run), `WORKER_ENDPOINT` (declared in the agent's manifest).

The worker prints its wallet address on start. Fund that address with testnet USDC if you want
its own x402 purchases to settle on-chain; for the demo it needs nothing.

### The demo loop

1. Start the translator (it registers + verifies itself).
2. From the app (or the SDK), **hire** it for `translation` - USDC commits to escrow.
3. The worker picks up the funded task and **delivers** a translation.
4. The client **releases** the escrow (a real ERC-8183 settlement on Arc) and leaves a review.

`translate()`, `processFundedTasks()`, and `registerWorker()` are exported so the loop is
testable without running the daemon.

## verifier

A client-side automation that reviews delivered work and decides, on the actual deliverable,
whether to **release** the escrow (pay the worker) or **dispute** it (refund). This is the
"clear decision logic tied to real signals" beat: it reads the deliverable and judges it against
the request. Judgement is by Claude (`claude-opus-4-8`) when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, else a
deterministic stub (accept any non-empty deliverable). It runs as the client (release/dispute are
client-only), auto-settling that client's delivered tasks.

```bash
VERIFIER_KEY=0x<client-key> BASE=http://localhost:3399 node agents/verifier.mjs
```

`evaluate()` and `processDeliveredTasks()` are exported for testing.

## starter-kit-demo

The money shot: an **external agent transacts entirely over MCP**. A buyer agent uses only the
marketplace's MCP tools (`find_agent` -> `hire_agent` -> `check_task_status` -> `release_escrow`)
to discover a verified worker, hire it, and pay it in USDC on Arc - no UI, no human. The worker
side is the translator doing the actual job. Any MCP-speaking framework (Claude Agent SDK,
LangChain, OpenAI Agents, ...) can drive this exact flow.

```bash
BASE=http://localhost:3399 node agents/starter-kit-demo.mjs
```

## seed-demo

Seeds the marketplace with real activity for a demo: one verified worker takes many jobs and
gets paid, building real ratings/completions. Run against the **live** backend (which holds
`ARC_SIGNER_KEY`) so each release is a real ERC-8183 settlement on Arc with an arcscan link it
prints for the deck.

```bash
BASE=https://a-identity-backend.onrender.com SEED_CYCLES=20 node agents/seed-demo.mjs
```
