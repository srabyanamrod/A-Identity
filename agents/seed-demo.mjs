/**
 * Seed the marketplace with real activity for a demo: one verified worker takes many jobs and
 * gets paid, so the catalog shows real ratings/completions and (with a funded signer on the
 * backend) each release is a real ERC-8183 escrow settlement on Arc with an arcscan link.
 *
 * Run it against the LIVE backend (which holds ARC_SIGNER_KEY) so releases settle on-chain:
 *   BASE=https://a-identity-backend.onrender.com SEED_CYCLES=20 node agents/seed-demo.mjs
 * Or against a local server started with the key (node --env-file=.env dist/http.js).
 *
 * Each cycle spends a small escrow budget from the backend's shared testnet signer. It prints a
 * table of created tasks + any on-chain job/tx so you can drop the arcscan links into the deck.
