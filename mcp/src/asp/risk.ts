/**
 * Pre-transaction counterparty risk assessment — the logic behind the ASP

 * trust signals (on-chain ERC-8004 identity, KYA attestation, 0-1000 reputation,
 * tenure), optionally sharpened by the transaction context (amount, payee).
 *
 * This is the one piece of NEW logic the OKX ASP adds on top of A-Identity's
 * existing engine: it composes the verified identity + reputation signals into a
 * single ALLOW/WARN/DENY decision an agent can act on before it pays a counterparty.
 * Pure and side-effect free so it unit-tests offline (no RPC, no keys).
