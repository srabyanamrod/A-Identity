/**
 * Optional OKX x402 payment layer for the ASP gateway.
 *
 * When the OKX Secured-Aggregator credentials + a recipient address are present, this
 * wraps the four paid tool routes with OKX's x402 middleware: an unpaid request is cut
 * with HTTP 402 + a payment challenge before it reaches business logic; after the buyer's
 * Agentic Wallet pays on X Layer (eip155:196), the request is replayed and served.
 *
 * Credential-gated, exactly like the rest of this backend (ARC_SIGNER_KEY, Circle keys):
 * with no creds the gateway runs in FREE mode (tools still work, nothing is charged), so
 * it is always deployable and testable. The SDK is imported DYNAMICALLY with loose typing
 * so `tsc` never hard-depends on it and a missing optional dep can't break the build or the
 * boot — it just falls back to free mode.
 *
 * NOTE: the OKX *seller* side requires OKX_API_KEY / OKX_SECRET_KEY / OKX_PASSPHRASE
 * (from web3.okx.com/onchainos/dev-portal). A recipient address alone is NOT enough —
 * settlement is brokered through OKX's facilitator via an HMAC-signed client.
