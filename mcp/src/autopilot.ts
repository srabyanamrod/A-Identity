/**
 * Autonomous agent run — the "autonomous economic experience" the Arc track asks for.
 *
 * A human sets a budget once; then the agent runs ON ITS OWN: it makes a sequence of
 * real gasless nanopayments to a service (pay-per-inference / streaming), deciding
 * before each one whether it stays within the budget you set. When the next payment
 * would breach the budget it STOPS ITSELF and pauses for a human — bounded authority,
 * demonstrated live, no human clicking each payment.
 *
 * Programmable payment logic: each settled payment also accrues a **protocol fee**
 * (basis points of volume) routed to an A-Identity treasury — the on-chain proof of
 * the "take a fee per settlement" model. The fee settles as one real nanopayment at
 * the end (aggregated so it clears the rail's sub-cent minimum).
 *
 * Built on the verified Nanopayments rail (`nanopay.ts`). Env-gated behind
 * ARC_SIGNER_KEY; a clean `prepared` no-op without it.
