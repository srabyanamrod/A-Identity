/**
 * Shared 2/2 Gnosis Safe treasury — the funder for the Merkle airdrop (airdrop.ts).
 *
 * Honesty first: a Gnosis Safe is created and operated with Safe's OWN audited contracts
 * via the official Safe app / Protocol Kit. We do NOT reimplement a multisig — that would
 * be both wrong and unsafe. This module (a) defines the canonical 2/2 config, (b) reads a
 * live Safe's real on-chain state (owners, threshold, USDC balance), and (c) documents the
 * fund → airdrop → sweep flow that connects the treasury to the claim contract.
 *
 * Reads need no key. The Safe's own transactions (fund the airdrop, sweep the remainder)
 * are signed by its 2 owners in the Safe app — human-on-the-loop, by design.
